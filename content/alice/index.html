In one of these emails highlighting a new research breakthrough, she saw a white rabbit with pink eyes!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 376.50px; height: 250.40px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 376.50px; height: 250.40px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Figure 1: A white rabbit with pink eyes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The white rabbit was waving at Alice from inside the screen, and Alice, even though she had completed an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, waved back. It was not that big of a surprise to her that this rabbit could walk around and wave &mdash; for it was easily possible to generate such things with a suitably trained model. However, when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, looked at it, and then hurried on, she was shocked. She quickly regained her senses and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under a hedge. She was so tired that we wished that she could follow the rabbit down into the hole. She was also feeling really dumb for wishing so. However, as soon as she looked into the dark hole, she felt lighter.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the more she looked into it, the lighter she got. Within a few seconds, she was being pulled towards the hole, as if she were made of light. She tried to yell for help, but either no voice came out of her mouth, or her sister was so lost in her book that she didn&rsquo;t hear a thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before falling down a very deep well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Quite unfortunately, she did not take her laptop with her. Oh, how was she to ever get out! Alice tried to remember what that research breakthrough was about. It is difficult to remember things when you are falling down.

There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. &ldquo;Dinah&rsquo;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&rdquo; (Dinah was the cat.) &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I&rsquo;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&rsquo;s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tried to make sense of what was happening. It is also difficult to make sense when you are falling down.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It is so curious&rdquo;, she said to herself, &ldquo;that I fell into a neural network. And that too, with a white rabbit. I better be looking around for that rabbit. It should be able to help me. Oh, I wish I was back home with Dinah.&rdquo;, when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up onto her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She ran as fast as she could towards the white rabbit with pink eyes. Usually, just a small run is enough to make her very tired, but for some reason, down this hole, she didn&rsquo;t feel tired at all! It was when she reached the rabbit that she realized that she did not know how to address it. Fearful of losing the rabbit again, she yelled, at the top of her voice, &ldquo;Excuse me, please, Mr. Rabbit!&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To her relief, the rabbit stopped at once and turned around on two legs facing Alice. &ldquo;I am very late. Oh dear, the Duchess will be very angry with me.&rdquo;, he said, rubbing his forehead with his hands.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please tell me what this place is, and how to get out of it.&rdquo;, urged Alice, almost about to cry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re entering Wonderland. It is a huge generative model that is supposed to learn the art of being clever, original, and inventive. Humans are not supposed to enter Wonderland as inputs though. You are a very naughty child, going into unknown and dark places without telling anyone. I have no idea how you&rsquo;ll be encoded, but that is what&rsquo;s going on. As you go ahead, be prepared for all sorts of kooky changes. Your conscience might also get dispersed &mdash; not that I know much though. As for how to get out, you need to get thrown out of the generator as a fake sample; good luck with that. The Duchess might tell you more. I gotta go. Ciao!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before Alice could even open her mouth and ask how she could find the Duchess, the white rabbit was gone. She tried to run after him, and in a while, she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were doors all around the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She went to a table across the hall, half hoping she might find a key on it. Instead, she found a little bottle on it, and around the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &ldquo;DRINK ME&rdquo; beautifully printed on it in large letters.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 488.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image31.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 488.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Figure 3: Alice, after drinking the potion that said DRINK ME.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This bottle was not marked &ldquo;poison,&rdquo; so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavor of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast) she very soon finished it off.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am getting smaller!&rdquo;, thought Alice. And soon indeed, she was so small that she was able to lie down and enter through the small gap in one of the doors, which led to a huge (at least, huge for our poor little Alice) garden.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Alice wondered what this potion did to her &mdash; whether it reduced her </span><span class="c16 c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://theaisummer.com/receptive-field/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668831541398765&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WgOphAvgHfgDjcMHgXz4g">receptive field</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the network (whatever that meant for human input streams), or whether this was a way to reduce her dimensions before being passed through another set of layers. She was close to tears yet again.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So Alice started thinking about things that could cheer her up. There was one thing that always cheered her up &mdash; and that was thinking about maths. So Alice sat down, and tried to divert her mind from all the sadness, and instead tried to think about all the things she had read about information theory.

Help please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The mouse gave a sudden leap.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 434.50px; height: 346.60px;"><img alt="" src="images/image36.jpg" style="width: 434.50px; height: 346.60px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Figure 4: &ldquo;The mouse gave a sudden leap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a few moments, the mouse calmed himself down. Alice started, &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Mouse. Really sorry to interrupt you.&rdquo; For you see, by now, Alice had learned that people in Wonderland did not like to be interrupted much.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, dear.&rdquo;, replied the mouse. &ldquo;I am Thomas.

So, let me start with a secret that only a few people know. Can you keep a secret?&rdquo;, he asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice was very good at keeping secrets. At least, she thought she was. In any case, she nodded vigorously.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the secret: Nothing is certain in the wonderland. And when nothing is certain, everything is possible. And when everything is possible &mdash; there is only one way to talk about anything that is reasonable &mdash; and that is to talk about what is probable. Everything has a probability, and it is this distribution of probabilities that holds the secret to life, the universe, and everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry to counter you, Mr. Thomas, but aren&rsquo;t some things fixed?

These are just some events that have already happened. My name could have been anyone out of a million options, and the shortest distance would have depended on where you started out.

They too got lost somewhere in this pool.&rdquo;, started Thomas, &ldquo; &mdash; as you may be aware, I am a professor &mdash; and I had asked my students to do some research on human subjects and get back with their conclusions on probability today.

She went:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The Invariance Principle states that when a lot of things change, we should search for what does not change. For example, here&rsquo;s a question (try it before you ask me the solution)</span><sup class="c8"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How do you fill an 8x8 chessboard with 1x2 dominoes when two diagonally opposite ones have been chipped off? The board would look like this:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 201.50px; height: 201.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image40.jpg" style="width: 201.50px; height: 201.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Figure 9: A chessboard with diagonal cells removed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a while, Alice continued to tell the solution:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Let L be the number of uncovered light squares, and D be the number of uncovered dark ones. The number </span><span class="c33">Z = D - L</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;is 2 at the beginning (since two light squares have been chipped off). When we add a </span><span class="c29">1x2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;domino, it covers equal light and dark squares. Thus, this number remains invariant. In order to fully tile the chessboard, we want Z to be 0 in the end. Due to the Invariance Principle, this can never happen. Alice assumed an expression of wonder from the listeners and continued. Here&rsquo;s another one:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8 c10">In an International Doctoral Symposium on Deep Learning hosted by </span><span class="c16 c8 c10"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ellis.eu/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668831541417695&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Kf7H6bVn8mYSmoc7zRFu7">ELLIS</a></span><span class="c8 c10 c14">, a lot of handshakes happened. Some people exchanged an odd number of handshakes (and were called odd people), while some exchanged an even number (called even people). Prove that throughout the 1-week symposium, there were always an even number of odd people. (Hint: the proof is invariant to the change in venue; it could have been the neuraLIPS conference instead.)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Alice was finished, she was quite satisfied with herself. She looked around and tried to understand what the others were talking about. It was a complete jungle, but somehow she was able to understand multiple people speaking all at once. Alice thought it could be because of her consciousness spreading along multiple paths in this maze of a network.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The clearest voice was that of Claire the Crab. She was saying something like this:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An invariant is a property of an object which remains unchanged when a transformation is applied to the object. Closely related is the idea of an &ldquo;equivariant&rdquo; &mdash; a property that undergoes the same transformation instead of remaining unchanged. These two concepts can help us understand a lot of ideas in AI.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, CNNs exhibit both of these properties at different places. The convolution operation is equivariant under translation &mdash; which means shifting the input correspondingly shifts the output. This allows the network to understand concrete structures such as edges, shapes, and patterns. As we go on to later layers, the receptive field of the output increases, and (if we have balanced the equivariance well enough with things like pooling), we observe invariance under translation &mdash; which aids generalization for a number of tasks.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, another class of networks, Graph Neural Networks, is designed to be invariant (or equivariant, based on the task at hand) to permutations.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">These invariances, though, are not </span><span class="c8 c10">per se</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;properties of these models.

From the other side, Alice could see that he was sitting on the mushroom with his hookah in one hand and playing chess.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She could not explain why, but this made her happy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She walked towards the Caterpillar and asked, &ldquo;Mr. Caterpillar, sorry to disturb your game, but could you please help me find the Duchess?&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Caterpillar responded, &ldquo;I do not know where the Duchess is, but I have some very important advice that will help you.&rdquo; He was very old and had a very wise kind of voice &mdash; similar to Gandalf&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice nodded since she was desperately looking for anything that could help her.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Caterpillar responded, &ldquo;But first, you help me win this stupid game.

He had one doubt though. He asked, &ldquo;So, it is an assumption in an MDP that the current state is all you need to figure out the next state? You don&rsquo;t need to know the previous states?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice nodded. &ldquo;Yes, and it makes a lot of computation easy. For example, in chess, you don&rsquo;t need to know the opponent&rsquo;s last move to find the best move. You just need to look at the board.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chrysalis replied, &ldquo;That is not true. Chess is not an MDP.

What is much, much more interesting and worth learning is the invention of the game. It is a beautifully crafted game, don&rsquo;t you think? It did not start in the form that it is now. A lot of trial-and-error went into the evolution of the game when travelers took it to different places from its raw origins in India.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Alice was very intrigued by the idea. She started thinking about how we could get an AI agent to </span><span class="c8 c10">invent</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;chess. &ldquo;If I knew&rdquo;, she thought, &ldquo;what exactly made chess so beautiful, then it&rsquo;s easy &mdash; I would just need a generator that creates new games and a discriminator that judges their beauty. Maybe in order to measure the beauty of the game, the discriminator will need to learn how to play it well. And maybe the generator would someday create a game that is, I daresay, even more beautiful than chess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">She also wondered whether these super-powerful models were </span><span class="c8 c10">actually</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;better than humans. </span><span class="c8 c10">Or animals</span><span class="c8">, a little voice inside her added. She thought, &ldquo;While it is true that humans will never be able to beat computers at chess, can we really say a chess-playing agent really understands chess? For example, if you asked a human chess grandmaster to do a </span><span class="c16 c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smothered_mate&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668831541436288&amp;usg=AOvVaw385Fa3k-1YRE6ARBQODksb">Smothered Mate</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or a back-rank mate on a (relatively weaker) opponent, they will most likely be able to adapt their game and successfully do it. But can an agent, without further training, stand up to a challenge like this one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alice was just thinking about all of these things when suddenly she remembered that she had to find the Duchess, and that the Chrysalis had some advice for her.

It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.

In fact, she could see and hear a number of different things as well, with different intensities. The more time passed, the more effort she had to put in to focus on what was transpiring right in front of her.

Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment&rsquo;s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat that was sitting on the hearth and grinning hysterically from ear to ear.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please would you tell me,&rdquo; said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, &ldquo;why your cat grins like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a cat,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;We thought it was a Cheshire cat, but it is actually a pig.

The queen got really annoyed at this, and shouted &ldquo;Off with his head&rdquo; at the white rabbit. The rabbit ran away into the woods, so the queen put up a grand prize of 700,000 Shannons.

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life; everyone had one flamingo with a collar attached to an end of a thin rope, and there was one single hedgehog as the ball. The goal, Alice figured, was for one of the flamingoes to search for the hedgehog amongst the water and underground plants</span><sup class="c8"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">. Like other games in the wonderland, if the hedgehog was found, everyone won.</span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in holding her flamingo with the rope, since it would twist itself around and look up in her face, and then start running instead of looking for the hedgehog. It donned such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing. Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.</span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c8">The King of Hearts came near Alice, and almost as if he had been hearing her thoughts, said, &ldquo;No, no dear!

Because in this large crowd of flamingoes, even though all of them have undergone the same amount of training, only a select few had the genetic material that was conducive to learning how to identify hedgehogs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">This was a very curious thing.
