The palpitations. Your legs are shaking. Your left hand is clenching and unclenching as if you were squeezing a stress ball. Your legs shake in five different ways, but you don&rsquo;t remember the other four right now. If you try to stop your left hand, the middle finger starts trembling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They are not your quivers; they simply use you as a siphon. As a conduit into this world. The middle finger flutters so quickly that you could see two of them if you were looking. Because your brain simply cannot process the fact that your left-hand does not have two middle fingers. You have never owned a stress ball. You saw a couple of stress balls once in one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Your teeth are jangling. It&rsquo;s nowhere near as fast as a shiver. You&rsquo;re sweating so much that even you could have smelled it. But you&rsquo;re not breathing enough to get the smell. The teeth chomp and chew as if you were eating. Every breath is as short as it can possibly be. You haven&rsquo;t eaten since yesterday. You haven&rsquo;t bathed since yestermonth. You breathe just enough to ensure your brain can get the energy to know whether to laugh at the next one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Your next blink might arrive any moment. Your body is a bundle of restlessness. You dread the next blink. You don&rsquo;t remember the last time you drank water. Every blink is like a mini-death. You dread it; prepare for it &mdash; and once it&rsquo;s passed, you refocus. Your ass is drenched in sweat. You can feel that it is cooler than the rest of your body &mdash; the sweat that&rsquo;s drenching your ass. Your only plea to God is that there&rsquo;s no satire in the next one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You don&rsquo;t laugh or cry or express (or even feel) any emotion as such; you just say a little &ldquo;meh&rdquo; inside your head, occasionally, and scroll. The thumb on your right-hand feels like the only part of your body under your control. You don&rsquo;t realize that whatever is controlling it is not really you. Your brain itself is out of your fucking control. Sarcasm you can &ldquo;meh&rdquo; at, but satire without sarcasm makes you pull on your hair and deeply regret wasting four hundred milliseconds from your precious </span><span class="c6 c7">just-before-the-next-blink</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;time. You don&rsquo;t want to leave it (the </span><span class="c6 c7">satire-without-sarcasm</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;reel) before you fully understand it so that after the blink you can start with a fresh one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">You&rsquo;re aware none of them are going to be even remotely funny or entertaining. Your eyes are ninety-five percent closed. For every second that you stretch your waking time, the tremors increase. If you could catch hold of the despicable shit-licking boredom-reeking asshole who made the ugly ones, you would &mdash; you fantasize &mdash; grab them by the neck and pull their insides out. And then use the grotesqueness of it to get off instead of the next one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You crave and you scroll. The day when you consumed your first one is a distant dream. 3. 2. 1. You have to blink; your eyes are burning. Nowadays, you don&rsquo;t consume them anymore; it&rsquo;s the other way around. Your eyes are so red that looking at them would make someone&rsquo;s eyes pain. Your heartbeat is increasing as you reach the point of no return. Your entire body&rsquo;s trembling faster. Oh God please make it a good one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But it&rsquo;s not. It never is. Your head is throbbing hard as if someone were scooping it with a spoon. Your eyes have given up, but there&rsquo;s one last effort they could muster. It has not yet reached your brain. There&rsquo;s a sum total of one drop of saliva inside your mouth, pharynx, and esophagus combined. By the time your eyes prepare for the next ten or so, your brain tries to make sense of this one. This one is a &ldquo;meh&rdquo;, so you double-tap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You lift your right thigh up, and an enormous fart pervades all the sweat. You&rsquo;re all caught up.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c5">&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;&#8902;</span></p></body></html>
