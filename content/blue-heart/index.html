But there are many organisms that don&rsquo;t have red blood. We spiders, for instance, have </span><span class="c0 c23">blue</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;blood, because Oxygen binds to the Copper present in Haemocyanin.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m Damian, a spider. Spiders come in a lot of different shapes and sizes. But not all are as friendly, as is the case with you humans. If I&rsquo;m not cautious enough, someday my wife might eat me</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">. Anyway, let me tell you something that you&rsquo;ll find interesting. So, I share my house with a human called Sam, and his family of one wife and two kids.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not that I can&rsquo;t afford my own, but I&rsquo;m fine here since they use just one of the six walls in each room. Also, they help me out in getting my food by leaving the house dirty, which is really helpful. I&rsquo;ve grown a bit slow with age and sometimes find it hard to catch prey.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">When I was young, a few weeks at the most, something really horrible happened. Sam is usually very reserved and does not interfere with my life, but he has a very mischievous offspring. I was sitting tight on the wall, waiting for a fly to get caught in my newly-composed web, when this offspring of Sam&rsquo;s came near me, with a pencil, and before I could comprehend his intentions, he started attacking me with the pointy end of the pencil. After around thirty failures, thirty times of me barely avoiding death, it hit my frontmost left leg. I was lucky it broke off . . . the frontmost left leg.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">So, I was left with seven legs, three on my left side, and four on my right. As to why I was lucky, it&rsquo;s because had the leg broken from anywhere else other than the joint, I would have lost a lot of blood, and thus would have been unable to move</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">. If a few of our legs get chopped off, we can still survive as long as we can balance. And those few legs also grow back when we molt.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">It was painful, but I tried to run away as fast as I could since I don&rsquo;t need telling that that brat would be ready with his next blow anytime. I started moving, but something was odd. I was moving in anticlockwise circles instead of a straight line. That was because I had learned to walk with four legs on each side. The kid was looking dangerous, with his two big eyes directly on me. I had to do something fast. I took a brave, painful decision. With all the strength I could muster, I used my forelegs to cut off my right frontmost leg too. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">At first, it was stiff, but in a jolt of excruciating pain, it broke off, just like the left one. I was now left with six legs. This was not a big problem since I would grow them back again. The bigger problem was the kid. I started running up the wall as fast as I could, and quickly got out of his reach, even with a pencil.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I sometimes wish I was bigger and stronger, so I could break one of the legs of that spoiled kid. Or a few fingers, at least. Anyway, I find happiness in his getting beaten by Sam, which happens almost every odd day these days since he&rsquo;s</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;home. I plan to write my entire life out, for anyone who wants to read the stories of a dreamy, solitary storyteller spider.</span></p><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3 c0">Before I move on though, let me take care of some unwanted visitors who&rsquo;ve turned up here.
